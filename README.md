# ELIZA Chatbot

This project is a client-side implementation of the famous ELIZA chatbot, one of the earliest AI programs designed to simulate a conversation with a therapist. The chatbot runs entirely in the browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no external libraries or APIs.

# What Does This Project Do?

This chatbot processes what you type and responds based on a series of predefined patterns, giving the impression that it’s listening and “understanding” you. The conversation happens right in the web browser, with no need for external servers or libraries.
