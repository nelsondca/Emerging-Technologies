These Tasks create text that mimics genuine English by using trigrams to create a model of English text patterns. It demonstrates how to use python in a few Project Gutenberg manuscripts to create,analyse,and export a trigram-based generator.

# Overview

A trigram is a sequence of three characters in text, like "THE" or "AND". We can simulate patterns in the English language by counting the instances of each trigram. Then we can produce fresh text that "sounds" like English by beggining with a seed and using these trigrams to generate text character by character.

# Goals

- Build a model from classic English texts
- Generate text based on the trigram model.
- Analysis of the generated text to see how much it looks like actual English.
- Export the trigram model as JSON file for reutilisation.
